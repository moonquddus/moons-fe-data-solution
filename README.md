### Welcome!

Hope you enjoy my solution! I've left the old readme in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` if you want to spin it up.

### Notes

- I actually encountered an issue running this. Hot reload for webpack wasn't working, and I found out it's a Windows issue. Added `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true` to the start script to make it work. If I had time, I would have ripped it out entirely and replaced it with Vite haha
- Went for a classical dashboard look for the solution, looks a bit basic but it does the job
- For the graph, I went for `chart.js`. I actually built something very similar at my previous role, and our first choice was `chart.js` because of how quickly you can prototype something. It has its flaws though, namely responsiveness was _very_ wonky for me, kinda disappointing. And adding a comment icon on top of each bar was exceedingly difficult. I found a better solution than what I did, it was just so hard to find because of documentation - quite surprising considering how popular it is, but it might have been because I was using the react wrapper.
- I went for a Notion-like comments box. You know when click on a block, and a comments box pops out on the right? Yeah, that. Think it works pretty well
- The "Generate share link" experience is a bit ugly if I'm honest, but I didn't want to spend _too_ much time on making everything pretty
- I went for good ol' vanilla CSS. It's suuuper underrated, and it's very mature these days! That being said, I would probably use PostCSS - add some scaffolding to support extra browsers, and a nesting plugin (I have realised that no nesting + BEM does not make for a pleasant experience)
- If I was building this to be prod-ready, I would have used a component library, and possibly Tailwind as well. It's important for an early startup to be able to ship something fast while still being high quality
- I actually decided not to create any custom global state in redux at all! I relied entirely on RTK's api middleware to handle api calls, and cache/refetch everything. It's really wonderful to use, and the team at redux have done such a great job in creating powerful tools that require less lines of code (manually setting up redux stores, thunks/saga, axios, etc is such a pain)
- I have a rough component structure in place, but for larger-scale apps I guess I would seperate by domain as well
- I was relatively thorough with the tests. I put a lot of integration tests in place - one of my beliefs is that integration tests provide the greatest documentation on a component, not comments. In theory, it should explain the entire business logic of a component
- That being said... there were so many places I could have done more. I missed out a lot of edge cases, and I could have arguably made more unit tests (deep object comparison instead of snapshots), as well as some cool functional tests in cypress if we wanted to. But again, I didn't want to go overkill on a tech test
- Oh and please excuse the messy commits hahaha. I like to use conventional commits in a professional environment, works well with release bots generating a changelog

### Improvements

- A bit more defensive rendering would be useful, as there's a lot that depends on API responses (so loading messages, error messages etc)
- Wasn't sure whether to show comments or not in the shared chart. Yeah, the comments will be useful for adding context, but it might contain sensitive information. Guess it's something I would have discussed
- Some auth work would have been cool, I don't mind writing some BE code for it
- As mentioned, probably would have used a component library and some styling framework to make this look fancier, quicker
- A share modal where you can generate the link and auto-copy to clipboard would have been sweet
- Possibly better responsiveness in general? Viewing charts in mobile is always a big problem (but solveable! With mobile gestures such as pinch zooming and swiping)
- e2e and functional tests would have been cool as well
- FE & BE models are very tightly coupled right now. A frontend application should theoretically be able to absorb and transform data from any generic BE service. In the future, I would have created a monolithic `Chart` model that included both the data points, and had an `comments` field as well. This model fits what FE is trying to achieve better. And probably would have kept it in a `chart-store` with redux
- The act of commenting is at heart, a collaborative experience. I know RTK's api middleware has lots of handy features for frequently fetching new data (eg polling) and we can use websockets to keep a live connection if we wanted to.
